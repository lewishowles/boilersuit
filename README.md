# Boilersuit

Boilersuit is a CLI built using Gluegun to help getting started with a project that will be based on the [`boilerplate`](https://github.com/lewishowles/boilerplate) template.

## First use

On first use of Boilersuit, I recommend adding an alias so that it's available from anywhere.

```
cd /path/to/boilerplate
bunx link
```

You can then use the `boilerplate` command from anywhere.
